This is the github release of the Kernel Library, for Hydra and DGD.  The
kernellib is and has always been in the public domain (even though it was
distributed with DGD), so this repository includes the full history.

A sample config file is here:

    /doc/kernel/kernel.dgd

Note from shentino:

If you wish to use the networking extensions of dgd with the kernel
library, use the "networking" branch of the kernel library hosted on
github by shentino, and not the "master" branch.

Kudos for Dread for reporting this documentation faux pau.
